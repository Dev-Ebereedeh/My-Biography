            <h2> Can I get to Know You?</h2>
         <p>Before anything else, I need you to know that beyond any labels, I am human. Yea just as complicated as you are. Hmmm...Let's get to the simple part. Incase you've forgotten, my name is <em><strong>Eberechukwu</strong></em>, and if you are wondering what that means, ooh well it means "God's Mercy". Fun fact, I never really liked my name growing up, I just couldn't understand why my parents resorted to such an uncute name, I mean these two adults had a whole nine months to come up with some cute name like Michelle, Lucy, you know what I mean. However, I made peace with my name, after a friend taught me this "a name doesn't make a man, rather a man makes the name". Ooh well, I will love to hear your thoughts on this...

                <h2>Personal Values</h2>
                To a large extent, I love life even though it gets really rocky sometimes. Before now, I would have reeled out a good number of truisms, the kind that would make you nod continously in affirmation, leaving you with quite a good impression of who I am or what I believe in. However, all of that wouldn't be neccessary because my experience in the past year has overwritten all that I have known my entire life. Given all the lessons that life has taught me, my personal values can be summarized in these two words..."Be Kind!"
