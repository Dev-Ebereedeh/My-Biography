    <h2> Can I get to Know You?</h2>
    <p>Before anything else, I need you to know that beyond any labels, I am human. Yea just as complicated as you are. Hmmm...Let's get to the simple part. Incase you've forgotten, my name is <em><strong>Eberechukwu</strong></em>, and if you are wondering what that means, ooh well it means "God's Mercy". Fun fact, I never really liked my name growing up, I just couldn't understand why my parents resorted to such an uncute name, I mean these two adults had a whole nine months to come up with some cute name like Michelle, Lucy, you know what I mean. However, I made peace with my name, after a friend taught me this "a name doesn't make a man, rather a man makes the name". Ooh well, I will love to hear your thoughts on this...

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>I wear so many hats, one too many that leaves me wondering "what in God's name I wan do with my life". As a young adult in Nigeria, I can say that I haved lived multiple lives with respect to my career journey. If you know anything about my country Nigeria, you will attest to how being birthed on this soil, automatically confers you with the unnatural ability to wanting to try out a thousand and one things, sadly not out of passion but in pursuit for survival. Within a decade, I have moved from being a thrift vendor, to owning a confectionery brand Grandmastreat as a pharmacy student, at some point I became a pharmacist graduate from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. And as a pharmacist  with all of these transitions one would think I would have made it to FORBES UNDER 30, but here I am pursing a career in software  development. Funny right? But who thinks about FORBES UNDER 30 in this part of the world? A friend of mine called Fawaz has the answer to this question.

    <h2>Personal Values</h2>
    To a large extent, I love life even though it gets really rocky sometimes. Before now, I would have reeled out a good number of truisms, the kind that would make you nod continously in affirmation, leaving you with quite a good impression of who I am or what I believe in. However, all of that wouldn't be neccessary because my experience in the past year has overwritten all that I have known my entire life. Given all the lessons that life has taught me, my personal values can be summarized in these two words..."Be Kind!"
