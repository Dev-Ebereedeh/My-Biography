    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>I wear so many hats, one too many that leaves me wondering "what in God's name I wan do with my life". As a young adult in Nigeria, I can say that I haved lived multiple lives with respect to my career journey. If you know anything about my country Nigeria, you will attest to how being birthed on this soil, automatically confers you with the unnatural ability to wanting to try out a thousand and one things, sadly not out of passion but in pursuit for survival. Within a decade, I have moved from being a thrift vendor, to owning a confectionery brand Grandmastreat as a pharmacy student, at some point I became a pharmacist graduate from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. And as a pharmacist  with all of these transitions one would think I would have made it to FORBES UNDER 30, but here I am pursing a career in software  development. Funny right? But who thinks about FORBES UNDER 30 in this part of the world? A friend of mine called Fawaz has the answer to this question.
